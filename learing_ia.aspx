      </h1>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">A public limited company offers shares to the general public and has limited liability. Its stock can be acquired by anyone, either privately through Initial Public Offering (IPO) or via trades on the stock market. It is strictly regulated and is required to publish its true financial health to its shareholders</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Every company on a stock exchange such as the LSE is a public limited company. One example is Rolls-Royce Holding PLC, the maker of Rolls Royce luxury cars.</p>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Sole proprietorship: When a business is owned by a single individual it is termed as a sole proprietorship. For example, Beauty supply stores, ice cream parlors and perhaps even your local pharmacies are examples of sole proprietorship businesses.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Partnership: When two or more people come together to own and operate a business, it is termed as a partnership. Accountancy and audit firms are very good examples of partnership businesses.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Limited liability company: A limited liability company is a corporate entity that is registered and has a separate legal identity. Hindustan Unilever is an example of a limited liability company. A limited liability company can be either a private limited company and public limited company.</p>

      <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">What does it mean for you, as an investor, when you invest in a listed public limited company?</h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">When you invest in a public limited company that’s listed in a stock exchange, you automatically become a shareholder of that company. Being a shareholder, gives you a claim on the profits of the company, which may be periodically distributed to all the shareholders in the form of dividends. Additionally, when the company is finally liquidated, you also get to enjoy a residual claim on the net assets after the company sets off all its existing liabilities.</p>

         <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">After the IPO listing process, the investors that are allotted shares become the shareholders or part owners of the company. This gives them voting rights on matters related to the company's business. The shareholders are also entitled to receive dividends from the profits that the company makes</p>

         

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">When you buy a share in a company, you're effectively becoming a part owner of that company. As a shareholder, with an equity stake in that business, the investment return you earn depends on the success or failure of the company itself.</p>
