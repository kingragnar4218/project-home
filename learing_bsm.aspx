      </h1>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The benefits of investment are many and varied. To understand why investment is important, it is necessary to know the difference that investing makes to your finances in the long run. Let’s consider an example to look into this.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Meet Amit. He’s a 30-year old who saves around Rs. 20,000 every month. Irrespective of any hikes in his monthly income and any changes in his expenditure, he diligently saves up the same amount each month.</p>

      <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Purpose of investment</h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">There’s so much talk of investing and investment options these days. But have you ever stopped to wonder about one fundamental question - what is the purpose of investment? The answer is quite simple, really. Investments need to help you achieve your life goals. This includes both short-term and long-term goals.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">And they vary from one person to another. One person may want to save up to buy their first house, another person may want to build a retirement fund, while yet another investor may want to financially secure their family. Since goals are so personal and unique, there’s no one-size-fits all investment plan.</p>

        <br class="hidden lg:inline-block">So, what’s the point of investing?
      </h1>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Notice how in the example above, investing money regularly brings about a huge difference in how it grows? That brings us to the main need to invest. The fundamental reason to invest your money is to create wealth.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">By creating wealth, you can secure your financial situation and meet your short-term and long-term goals. And investing your money helps you do just that. </p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">For instance, by merely saving your money regularly, you could maybe get the car of your dreams in another 10 years. But when you invest your money in the right instruments, your money grows exponentially, so you can realise your goals faster. </p>

      <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">To meet your life goals</h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">You may have many major and minor goals in life, such as starting your own line of business, buying the car of your dreams, or constructing your dream house. Merely saving up a part of your income may not be enough to meet these targets. Add to that the ever-increasing costs - and paying for your child’s education or wedding a few years down the line may even be impossible with merely your savings. </p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Here’s where investments come in handy. You’ve seen how it may be possible to earn up to Rs. 2 crores with just a monthly investment of Rs. 20,000. That could be adequate to meet many life goals. And the cherry on the top is that you can meet your objectives without incurring any debts whatsoever!</p>
