      </h1>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">A home loan is essentially a loan that you take to fund the construction or purchase of a house. One of the highlights of a home loan is that you can use the amount that you borrow to purchase both new or old houses.</p>
        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Generally, home loans are offered only up to 80% to 90% of the total value of the house. The remaining 20% to 10% of the value of the house has to be funded by you, out of your own pocket, in the form of a down payment.</p>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">A personal loan is a kind of a loan that you can avail from a financial institution for satisfying your financial needs and requirements. What sets personal loans apart from other types of loans is the fact that there are absolutely zero restrictions with respect to the usage of the loan amount. This effectively means that you can use a personal loan for almost anything from paying for a vacation to purchasing a new television. </p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">ou would have to approach a financial institution like a bank or an NBFC, fill the personal loan application form, and submit it along with the necessary documents. Nowadays, almost all financial institutions these days allow you to avail an online personal loan within just a few minutes, from the comfort of your own home. </p>

      </h1>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The long-term nature of a loan and the amount of financial burden that it adds begs the question, ‘should you take a loan in the first place?’. Unfortunately, there’s no right answer to this question. It all depends on the individual and the kind of needs and requirements that they have.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">It is true that not all situations demand a person to initiate a loan process. Some can be handled without having to resort to a loan or a credit facility. But others, especially those situations involving big ticket expenses may require external financial assistance. And that’s precisely what we’re going to take a look at in this chapter of Smart Money. </p>
