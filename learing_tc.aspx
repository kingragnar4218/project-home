      </h1>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Businesses, nature, trends. What do these things have in common? They are cyclical, and in many cases, seasonal. For instance, consider the example of a restaurant on Goa Beach. It might make plenty of profits in the month of November-February. But come Monsoon, the demand will lower dramatically. It makes sense. After all, who goes to Goa in Monsoon?</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Now, think about a stock. A stock that is representative of a seasonal industry might boom during certain times of the year, but could be relatively inactive during the off seasons.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">As an investor, you could potentially look at these seasonal trends and stand to gain from taking advantage of the resulting rise and fall of a stock. Of course, this requires plenty of in-depth analysis and research.</p>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Companies that are expected to come out with strong financial results see a bounce in their share prices. Short-term investors can take advantage of this trend by buying into shares in the last month of the quarter such as December or March.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">If you are wondering how to pick up those shares, the figures given by various companies during the last quarter, the expectations of the management for the next quarter, news that circulates around about the company and the mood of industry in general – all these factors, if closely followed up, can give you clues.</p>

      </h1>

      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The union budget is presented by the Finance Minister in the month of February. Companies expected to benefit from the provisions of the Budget see their stock prices moving up ahead of the Budget-Day. Investors can buy into such stocks for short term profits. A general follow up of the pre budget discussions that goes around in channels and newspapers should serve as a quick guide to get clues</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The Union Budget of India contains a list of financial proposals and estimates and is generally referred to as the ‘Annual Financial Statement’ under Article 112 of the Constitution of India. As the name states, the country’s budget is prepared for a respective financial year which involves estimates of earnings from revenues and expenditures of the government. The Budget is seen as the financial roadmap and is a lengthy process as it requires months of gatherings from central and state ministries, authorities and departments. The performance of last year’s budget is taken into account while preparing for budgeted estimates and guidelines of the coming year.</p>

      <h1 class="title-font sm:text-4xl text-3xl mb-4 font-medium text-gray-900">Trading During Monsoons</h1>
      <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">It is important to understand that Agriculture is the main strength of India’s economy. The performance of agriculture certainly matters in determining how healthy the stock market would be. For this reason, if the monsoon turns out to be below expectations, then it certainly hits the economy of India in a negative way.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">Indian companies derive a significant portion of their earnings from rural areas in the country. While some companies are directly dealing in the agriculture market like seeds, agro-chemicals, fertilisers etc, certain other companies in the FMCG and auto space indirectly benefit from a robust rural economy.</p>

        <p class="mb-8 leading-relaxed">The monsoon has a direct impact on the inflation rate prevalent in the economy. This spirals into public investments rate, government savings, foreign exchanges reserves of the nation. When such a high stake the economy has on monsoon, it is obvious that the share market's performance will be affected by the monsoon.</p>
